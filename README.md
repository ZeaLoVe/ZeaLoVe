## Experiences

I am ZeaLoVe. I am from China.

I have a master's degree and major in Software Engineering at [Wuhan University](https://whu.edu.cn/). 

I work as a DevOps engineer focused on container orchestration and automation.

I am an open source enthusiast, but still learning how to make a difference.
